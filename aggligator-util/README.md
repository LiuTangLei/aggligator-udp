This crate provides utility functions and command line tools for working with the
[Aggligator link aggregator].

It provides the following functionality:
  * functions for establishing a connection consisting of aggregated TCP,
    Bluetooth RFCOMM links and WebSocket links,
  * optional TLS link authentication and encryption,
  * a text-based, interactive connection and link montor,
  * a speed test.

The following command line tools are included:
  * `agg-speed` — performs a speed test over a connection of aggregated TCP links,
  * `agg-tunnel` — forwards arbitrary TCP ports over a connection of aggregated TCP links.

Both tools display a text-based, interactive connection and link monitor.
